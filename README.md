# Digital-Signature-App
Multi-Signature PDF Signing Web Application is a Spring Boot-based system that allows users to upload PDF documents and add multiple draggable signatures (text or image-based). The application converts browser coordinates to PDF coordinates to ensure accurate placement and generates a newly signed PDF using Apache PDFBox.
